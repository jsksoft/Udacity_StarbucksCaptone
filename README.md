# Udacity Starbucks Capstone Challenge
Capstone project Starbucks
Udacity Nanodegree: Date Science

# Objective
In this project I try mo improve the advertisement strategy for Starbucks. <br>
To be succesful on this task I will mainly focus on the following five quesitons:
* What are the most predictive features or parameters for a completed offer
* What are the relations between the customer age, income and offer completion rate?
* Is the customer gender important for the offer completion rate?
* What is the most important channel for completing an offer?
* Is there any correlation between the offer types and offer completion rate?

# Libraries
The code is written in Python3 and following python libraries are used within the project:
* pandas
* numpy
* math
* json
* time
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn


# Dataset
The simulated dataset has been provided by Starbucks and Udacity. 
It contains the follwing files:
* portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)
* profile.json - demographic data for each customer
* transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
